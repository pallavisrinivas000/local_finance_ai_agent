# local_finance_ai_agent

A local AI agent that answers questions about your monthly finance documents using vector search and embeddings.

## Overview

This project processes your bank transaction CSV (e.g., `aug_expenses.csv`), converts each transaction into a vector embedding, and stores them in a vector database (ChromaDB). You can then query your financial data using natural language, and the agent retrieves the most relevant transactions.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Reads your bank statement CSV using `pandas`.
2. **Embedding:** Converts each transaction into a vector using `OllamaEmbeddings` from `langchain-ollama`.
3. **Vector Database:** Stores the embeddings and metadata in a local ChromaDB instance using `langchain-chroma`.
4. **Retrieval:** Uses vector similarity search to find and return the most relevant transactions for your queries.

## Libraries Used

- **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):**  
  For reading and processing CSV files containing your transaction data.

- **[langchain](https://python.langchain.com/):**  
  Provides the framework for chaining together language model and vector database operations.

- **[langchain-ollama](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-ollama):**  
  Supplies the `OllamaEmbeddings` class, which generates vector representations (embeddings) of your transaction text using local models.

- **[langchain-chroma](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-chroma):**  
  Integrates ChromaDB with LangChain, allowing you to store and retrieve document embeddings efficiently.

## What is a Vector Database?

A vector database stores data as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) instead of traditional rows and columns. This allows for efficient similarity searchâ€”finding items that are "close" in meaning or context. In this project, each transaction is embedded as a vector, enabling semantic search over your financial records.

### Why ChromaDB?

[ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) is an open-source vector database designed for AI and LLM applications. It is used here to persist and search your transaction embeddings locally, ensuring privacy and fast retrieval.
